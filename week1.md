- worked on [mario's pyramid](https://docs.cs50.net/problems/mario/less/mario.html), didn't finish. 

#### November 18th, 2017
- watched Week 1 lecture from minute 56 and on. Learned about numbers - integers, decimals, floats, etc. 
- examples of how to write better code (don't use a variable if you don't need to)
- source code -> compiler -> machine code
- *preprocessing* (#include, "hey computer, do something with this file before you compile this code")
- *compiling* (going from source code to 'assembly code')
- *assembling* (takes assembly code to 0's and 1's)
- *linking* ("Hey computer, take all the 0's and 1's from the assembly code along with everything else then compile into one program")
- look for patterns when solving problems
